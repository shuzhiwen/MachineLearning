# Description

## Deep Learning

- Some [examples](./deep-learning/example) for keras and tensorflow
- Useful [materials](./deep-learning/material) for learning deep learning

## Machine learning

1. [sample.py](./traincascade/sample.py) making some positive samples using affine transformation
2. [resize.py](./traincascade/resize.py) reducing samples to a size that opencv is suitable for processing
3. [describe.py](./traincascade/describe.py) generating description file for samples
4. [opencv_traincascade](./traincascade/opencv_traincascade) training model that we want
5. [test.cpp](./traincascade/test.cpp) using the model to detect new samples
